### Hi there 👋
My name is Mohammad Mahdi but most people just call me Mahdi. I am interested in computer science and technology. I am a newbie in github and still don't know how it works, ZOINKS!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on improving my coding skills.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning cpp?

- 🤔 I’m looking for help with github.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I like whitespaces a lot.
